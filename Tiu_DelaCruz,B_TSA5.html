                adventures. Originally, Smurfette was crafted by Gargamel as a plan to destroy the Smurfs just by being
                a girl. Then Papa Smurf worked his magic and turned Smurfette into a lovely, loving Smurf and an
                important member of the clan.</p>

                nature and willingness to help. Despite his accidents, Clumsy is determined to succeed and he tries hard
                to overcome his clumsiness, but sometimes it just happens.</p>

                others all look up to. He is 542 years old, and he can change tacks and find a solution to every
                situation, even as the Smurfs are continually challenging and testing the rules. Papa Smurf can do
                magic, and he keeps a laboratory where he creates potions for a variety of uses.</p>

                fly attacked the Smurfs. Every single day since then, Grouchy wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and
                mutters to himself about all the things he hates. But who knows what else goes on in his mind? Because
                occasionally, when nobody is looking, he exhibits a secret love for something, like flowers.</p>

                everyone else. This is a Smurf who does not suffer from self-doubt. Brainy considers himself the most
                responsible member of the band and has proclaimed himself the right-hand man to Papa Smurf. He loves to
                talk, and he is often repeating phrases such as, Like Papa Smurf always says… or Papa Smurf is always
                right, and when he says that… The other Smurfs just roll their eyes and find inventive ways to shut him
                up.</p>
